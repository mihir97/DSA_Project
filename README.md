Please install portaudio and fftw libraries to compile the program.

The program outputs the values after applying fft to the recorded sample.
For similar words spoken these values are almost similar

The program callibrates initially to remove noise from the recorded samples
After that it records for 2 seconds and prints the fft values in file mentioned
These values are almost similar for same word(can be verified by plotting graph using gnuplot)

Sample data will be saved and an algorithm is to be written to search from sample data and check similarities and print it.
